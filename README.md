# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzles.

Note that most of the solutions are written in [Python](https://www.python.org/). They are written to be practical and readable, not necessarily fast or elegant. These solutions are intended to show how I would solve the problems, not necessarily the best way to solve them.
